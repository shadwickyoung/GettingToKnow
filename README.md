# Getting to Know My Values

Pat Berry (@build.com) introduced me to this concept and I thought...I've shared this info in other avenues but not in a widespread channel with many of my peers (e.g. the tech community). Pat originally created a Leadership README inspired by [Katie Womersley](https://medium.com/@kawomersley/why-and-how-to-share-your-manager-readme-plus-heres-mine-8a4fe188ee1b) and great ideas spread fast!

The goal of this document is to share thoughts on how I perceive leadership, my values, and an easy "get to know me as a person" doc. 



## My Leadership Philosophy 

I strongly believe in servant leadership. **What does this mean you ask?** 

Servant leadership was coined by [Robert K. Greenleaf](https://www.greenleaf.org/) in "The Servant as Leader," an essay published in 1970. The idea is: as a leader you serve first (intentionally) and this becomes your natural inclination. There's no power drive and your goal is to see other people's highest priority needs met. Serving others should reflect in them becoming healthier, wiser, more autonomous, and inherently more prone to serve others in the same way.  There's also a focus on the well-being of of the people and communities you belongs to. Shared power, putting others first, and developing others. That's what we like to see! 

### Other Nuggets on Leadership

1. Be Authentic! Be yourself. Motivate by focusing on the bigger picture, following your values, and focusing on long-term success

2. Be Ethical! Respect others. Trust others. Honesty wins. Chivalry's not dead. Do things fairly. 

3. Be Flexible! Change happens and you evangelize adoption. Embrace new ideas and always open to improvement!

  ## My answers to first 1:1 Questions

**What makes you grumpy?**

- It takes quite a bit to make me upset. Not Respecting others and being inconsiderate/rude.  
- Being disingenuous. Be authentic and communicate if you need help!
- When "people" are overlooked in making decisions. *Relationships are more important than any metric/argument/process out there.* 
- Aggressive Defensiveness (not sure if that's a thing). Conflict will happen and it's important to deal with it in a responsive way akin to the mindset of "we're all in this together to achieve a common goal." Don't let stubbornness get in the way. 
- Lack of sleep.

**How will I know when you're grumpy?**

- I'll say something. My skin is fairly thick and if something is bothering me, I'll vocalize it. You likely won't be able to tell if I'm having a bad day from my general demeanor, body language and actions.  I'll stay positive and keep the mood upbeat.

**How can I help you when you're grumpy?**

- At this point, I'll have voiced something. Be honest. Maybe I'm in the wrong and need a reality check. Be an advocate for truth. If it's a good idea that should get some traction, help promote and develop it.  If it's an issue that makes  sense to resolve, help me solve it! 

**What medium do you like feedback in -chat, email, in person, etc.?**

- Depends! By default in-person ( in-person or via video chat. If it's something that's not complicated or a quick snippet, chat and email works. If it's a sleep thing, encourage me to take it easy (because I will keep working)

**What routine do you like feedback in- routine like in 1:1s, or as it happens?**

- As it happens. If it requires a longer conversation, we can set up some time. 1:1s are for learning about each other. 

**How do you prefer to receive recognition (public or private)?**

- I don't mind being an unsung hero but it's nice to have public recognition (mostly for job security and future growth). Most of the time I'm for success being associated as a  "team effort" and I don't need to be "the guy" who did "the thing"

**What makes 1:1 the most valuable for you?**

I want to convey my dreams and aspirations

I want to learn about you and understand what you need from me

I just want to get to know you

**What are your goals for this year? Next 3 months?**

- Let's start with **3 months**. As of writing this, I'd like to pass the PMI-ACP exam. It's something I've been procrastinating and I should just do it. 
- **Year-long** goal. I'd like to continue developing old and build new relationships within Ferguson, Build, Supply, etc., learn more about our business, and help my team(s) achieve their goals.  I also want to lead the charge on process improvement at Build.com. Anything more specific than that...ask me in a couple months.
  - Unrelated, I'm working on a book, a few other side projects, and have some dad, husband, and family goals which are highest priority for me. 

 **What do you need from your manager?**

- Autonomy. Trust. Feedback. Growth Opportunities. Guidance. Advancement. 

**From your team?**

- Communication. Flexibility. Hunger (drive) Humility. Accountability. 

**From your peers (outside the team)**

- Keeping everyone looped in. Breaking down silos. Sharing visions and aligning on common goals. Working together for the same outcome. 

**What's your favorite baked good? **

- Nana's chocolate chip cookies. Bar-none. Just need milk.
