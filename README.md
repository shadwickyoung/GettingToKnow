# Getting to Know My Values

Pat Berry (@build.com) introduced me to this concept and I thought...I've shared this info in other avenues but not in a widespread channel with many of my peers (e.g. the tech community). Pat originally created a Leadership README inspired by [Katie Womersley](https://medium.com/@kawomersley/why-and-how-to-share-your-manager-readme-plus-heres-mine-8a4fe188ee1b) and great ideas spread fast!

The goal of this document is to share thoughts on how I perceive leadership, my values, and an easy "get to know me as a professional" doc. 



## My Leadership Philosophy 

I strongly believe in servant leadership. **What does this mean you ask?** 

Servant leadership was coined by [Robert K. Greenleaf](https://www.greenleaf.org/) in "The Servant as Leader," an essay published in 1970. The idea is: as a leader you serve first (intentionally) and this becomes your natural inclination. There's no power drive and your goal is to see other people's highest priority needs met. Serving others should reflect in them becoming healthier, wiser, more autonomous, and inherently more prone to serve others in the same way.  There's also a focus on the well-being of of the people and communities you belongs to. Shared power, putting others first, and developing others. That's what we like to see! 

### Other Nuggets on Leadership

1. Be Authentic! Be yourself. Motivate by focusing on the bigger picture, following your values, and focusing on long-term success
2. Be Ethical! Respect others. Trust others. Honesty wins. Chivalry's not dead. Do things fairly. 
3. Be Flexible! Change happens and you evangelize adoption. Embrace new ideas and always open to improvement!
