# Getting to Know My Values

Pat Berry (@build.com) introduced me to this concept and I thought...I've shared this info in other avenues but not in a widespread channel with many of my peers (e.g. the tech community). Pat originally created a Leadership README inspired by [Katie Womersley](https://medium.com/@kawomersley/why-and-how-to-share-your-manager-readme-plus-heres-mine-8a4fe188ee1b and great ideas spread fast!

The goal of this document is to share thoughts on how I perceive leadership, my values, and an easy "get to know me as a professional" how-to.

I strongly believe in servant and thought leadership. What does this mean you ask? Servant leadership was coined by Robert K. Greenleaf in "The Servant as Leader," an essay published in 1970. The idea is as a leader you serve first
