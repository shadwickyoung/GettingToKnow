# Why>README

Pat Berry (@build.com) introduced me to this concept and I thought...I've shared this info in other avenues but not in a widespread channel with many of my peers (e.g. the tech community). Pat originally created a Leadership README inspired by [Katie Womersley](https://medium.com/@kawomersley/why-and-how-to-share-your-manager-readme-plus-heres-mine-8a4fe188ee1b) and great ideas spread fast!

The goal of this document is to share thoughts on how I perceive leadership, my values, and an easy "get to know me as a person" doc. 



## My Leadership Philosophy 

I strongly believe in servant leadership. **What does this mean you ask?** 

Servant leadership was coined by [Robert K. Greenleaf](https://www.greenleaf.org/) in "The Servant as Leader," an essay published in 1970. The idea is: as a leader you serve first (intentionally) and this becomes your natural inclination. There's no power drive and your goal is to see other people's highest priority needs met. Serving others should reflect in them becoming healthier, wiser, more autonomous, and inherently more prone to serve others in the same way.  There's also a focus on the well-being of of the people and communities you belongs to. Shared power, putting others first, and developing others. That's what we like to see! 

### Other Nuggets on Leadership

1. Be Authentic! Be yourself. Motivate by focusing on the bigger picture, following your values, and focusing on long-term success

2. Be Ethical! Respect others. Trust others. Honesty wins. Chivalry's not dead. Do things fairly. 

3. Be Flexible! Change happens and you evangelize adoption. Embrace new ideas and always be open to improvement!

  ## My answers to first 1:1 Questions

**What makes you grumpy?**

- It takes quite a bit to make me upset. Not Respecting others and being inconsiderate/rude.  
- Being disingenuous. Be authentic and communicate if you need help!
- When "people" are overlooked in making decisions. *Relationships are more important than any metric/argument/process out there.* 
- Aggressive Defensiveness (not sure if that's a thing). Conflict will happen and it's important to deal with it in a responsive way akin to the mindset of "we're all in this together to achieve a common goal." Don't let stubbornness get in the way. 
- Lack of sleep.

**How will I know when you're grumpy?**

- I'll say something. My skin is fairly thick and if something is bothering me, I'll vocalize it. You likely won't be able to tell if I'm having a bad day from my general demeanor, body language and actions.  I'll stay positive and keep the mood upbeat.

**How can I help you when you're grumpy?**

- At this point, I'll have voiced something. Be honest. Maybe I'm in the wrong and need a reality check. Be an advocate for truth. If it's a good idea that should get some traction, help promote and develop it.  If it's an issue that makes  sense to resolve, help me solve it! 

**What medium do you like feedback in -chat, email, in person, etc.?**

- Depends! By default in-person ( in-person or via video chat. If it's something that's not complicated or a quick snippet, chat and email works. If it's a sleep thing, encourage me to take it easy (because I will keep working)

**What routine do you like feedback in- routine like in 1:1s, or as it happens?**

- As it happens. If it requires a longer conversation, we can set up some time. 1:1s are for learning about each other. 

**How do you prefer to receive recognition (public or private)?**

- I really don't mind being an unsung hero and would prefer to share recognition with others. The ONLY reason I'd ever want public recognition is job security and I'm okay without having that as well.  I'm of the mindset that success should be associated as a  "team effort" and I don't need to be "the guy" who did "the thing"

**What makes 1:1 the most valuable for you?**

- I want to convey my dreams and aspirations
- I want to learn about you and understand what you need from me
- I just want to get to know you

**What are your goals for this year? Next 3 months?**

- Let's start with **3 months**. As of writing this, I'd like to pass the PMI-ACP exam. It's something I've been procrastinating and I should just do it. 
- **Year-long** goal. I'd like to continue developing old and build new relationships within Ferguson, Build, Supply, etc., learn more about our business, and help my team(s) achieve their goals.  I also want to lead the charge on process improvement at Build.com. Anything more specific than that...ask me in a couple months.
  - Unrelated, I'm working on a book, a few other side projects, and have some dad, husband, and family goals which are highest priority for me. 

 **What do you need from your manager?**

- Autonomy. Trust. Feedback. Growth Opportunities. Guidance. Advancement. 

**From your team?**

- Communication. Flexibility. Hunger (drive) Humility. Accountability. 

**From your peers (outside the team)**

- Keeping everyone looped in. Breaking down silos. Sharing visions and aligning on common goals. Working together for the same outcome. Being both considerate and logical. 

**What's your favorite baked good? **

- Nana's chocolate chip cookies. Bar-none. Just need milk. 

## My expectations of folks who report to me

At the time of writing this, I don't have anyone reporting to me in my current role. I've had as many as 15 direct reports at once and I have some general best practices that I've shared to help me help them:

- Be [humble, hungry (driven) and smart (people smart)](https://www.tablegroup.com/books/ideal-team-player). This makes for great team members. 
- Ask questions. Be curious about what's happening throughout the organization, how it impacts you, and how you can help.
- When I ask what you need, please tell me. If I know what you want/need, I can take actionable steps to help. If you're struggling with something, ask for help. Don't wait until a 1:1 for help. Bug me. Message me. Walk up to me.
- Leave room for some grace. I won't always have the answer, but I'll do my best to get it. I'm human. I mess up. I'll probably forget something. I won't get frustrated by you asking something multiple times. I'm your advocate. Keep asking! 

## What you can expect of me as your manager

1. I'm for you, not against you. I'll promote you, consul you, listen and understand your concerns, and provide real-actionable-feedback. 
2. I will give you the good and bad news directly. I'll keep you informed of anything impacting you. 
3. I'll want to learn about you as a person not just a professional. I'll act like a human being and show kindness and consideration knowing that everyone's situation is different and there is no one-size-fits-all to help. 
4. I'll set a high bar for you and provide opportunities to go above said bar. I'll help along the way too. 
5. I'll provide ways for you to learn, improve, and grow. 
6. I won't  micro-manage you. My goal is to empower, not control. 

## My Influences

I've been a Christian the majority of my life. I've learned a lot of my leadership and decision-making processes as well as "being a kind human being" from Jesus and his teachings. 

I've also had some great mentors through the years Nana (my grandma), Kylie (my wife), Rich (my father in-law), Shaunna, Nicki, and Sam Allen (my pastor)) who have taught me either about life, business, or both! There's many others from my friends growing up, through my time at Chico State, Milestone, my time with Googlers, and my current job at Build.com.

For those humans I don't know personally but have somehow influenced me professionally or in life see below (no real order):

- Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, and Solomon (and others but those are my favorite), C.S Lewis, MLKJ ,Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, Aristotle, Martin Luther, David Platt, Francis Chan, Simon Sinek, Patrick Lencioni, Switchfoot and Muse (probably my two favorite bands). There's definitely more but that's the first ones that come to mind. 

## My Values

At the end of the day it's all about people. Being loving to each other and supporting one another. Helping each other grow and learn and succeed in our goals. Family is of the utmost importance and as a dad and husband I've learned to value this above anything material. I do my best to promote love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
